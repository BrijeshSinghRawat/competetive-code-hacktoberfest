#Diffie-Hellman Key Exchanged Algorithm with Example
====================================================
"""
Step 1: Alice and Bob get public numbers P = 23, G = 9

Step 2: Alice selected a private key a = 4 and
        Bob selected a private key b = 3

Step 3: Alice and Bob compute public values
Alice:    x =(9^4 mod 23) = (6561 mod 23) = 6
        Bob:    y = (9^3 mod 23) = (729 mod 23)  = 16

Step 4: Alice and Bob exchange public numbers

Step 5: Alice receives public key y =16 and
        Bob receives public key x = 6

Step 6: Alice and Bob compute symmetric keys
        Alice:  ka = y^a mod p = 65536 mod 23 = 9
        Bob:    kb = x^b mod p = 216 mod 23 = 9

Step 7: 9 is the shared secret.
